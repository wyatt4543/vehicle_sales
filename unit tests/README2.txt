All unit tests in their current form were written by Wyatt McDonnell

Assuming you already have all of the dependencies for Python from README1 run the following for testing: 
pip install pytest

First, open command prompt in the main directory. Then, follow either step for testing.

To run the tests automatically type:
pytest "unit tests"

To run an individual test type:
pytest "unit tests"/test_name.py
